# Hello, my name is Samuel Mallia!

My passion is bringing ideas to life through engineering and creativity! Through this and a love of learning new things, I have developed interests in Music, Art, Programming, as well as other hobbies like hiking, camping, reading, and climbing. Lately I have been volunteering at the [Champaign Aviation Museum](https://www.champaignaviationmuseum.org/)  to help out with some of their programming needs!

# Featured & WIP Projects:

  - **Gun Turret Simulation**: Currently, I am volunteering at the [Champaign Aviation Museum](https://www.champaignaviationmuseum.org/). At this museum I have been tasked with motion tracking a .50 cal plane turret and creating a simulation using this gun as a controller. To do this, I have used C++ to expose OpenCV code to Unity used to track ArUco markers.

  - **[Fallout Handheld Device - Embedded Project](https://github.com/Mizeress/Fallout-Game-System/tree/main)**: This is my foray into the embedded Linux World. This project will ultimately be a full vertical slice of an Embedded Linux Solution. The result will be a handheld gaming platform capable of running Fallout 1 & Fallout 2, and will be scalable for future game additions. The software stack focuses on using Yocto or Buildroot to create a minimal linux distribution and use of custom kernel interfacing to handle input from buttons and an analog stick. Games specific systems will be containerized for scalability. 

  - **[Musician's Companion](https://github.com/Mizeress/Capstone_MusiciansCompanion)**: A Spring Boot web application that provides some useful tools for musicians. This app was my Capstone Project for my Associate's of Applied Science at Columbus State Community College. This app contains what I could finish in a single semester and nothing more.

  - **[Background randomizer](https://github.com/Mizeress/RandomBackground)**: A Java App that automatically changes your desktop background at given intervals. The app is controlled by a config file through which you can input the time interval and whether to use a local directory or an API endpoint to get the image. This config file can be controlled via a GUI. The ultimate goal will be for this to work cross-platform. This project is a good example of a simple Java application using Object-Oriented Development principles.
