# Hello, my name is Samuel Mallia!

My passion is bringing ideas to life through engineering and creativity! Through this and a love of learning new things, I have developed interests in Music, Art, Programming, as well as other hobbies like hiking, camping, reading, and climbing. Lately I have been volunteering at the [Champaign Aviation Museum](https://www.champaignaviationmuseum.org/)  to help out with some of their programming needs!

# Featured & WIP Projects:
  - **[Background randomizer](https://github.com/Mizeress/RandomBackground)**: A Java App that will automatically change your desktop background at given intervals. The app will be controlled by a config file through which you can input the time interval and whether to use a local directory or an API endpoint to get the image. Eventually, this will be controlled through a UI. The ultimate goal will be for this to work cross-platform. 

  - **Gun Turret Simulation**: Currently, I am volunteering at the [Champaign Aviation Museum](https://www.champaignaviationmuseum.org/). At this museum I have been tasked with motion tracking a .50 cal plane turret and creating a simulation using this gun as a controller. To do this, I have used C++ to expose OpenCV code to Unity used to track ArUco markers.

  - **Air Foil Simulation**: WIP project using python to simulate airflow around airfoils in the Selig data format. Stretch goal is to create a user input pipeline that allows the user to hand draw an airfoil and convert the drawing to Selig Format in the simulation. Additional stretch goal is to allow the user to input desired specs and have the program attempt to generate an airfoil with specs as close to those specified as possible.
