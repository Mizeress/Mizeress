Hello, my name is Samuel Mallia! I am a student at Wright State University studying for a BACS in Computer Science.

Two projects that I intend to work on during this semester include:
  Background randomizer: A simple Java app to randomize my desktop's background. This code will call a batch file or powershell script that will accept an image and change the desktop background. 
  The Java code will house a UI to change settings such as time intervals, whether the image is randomized from a specified directory or pulled from an API, and similar settings. 

  Gun Turret Simulation: I am currently volunteering at a museum. At this museum I have been tasked with motion tracking a .50 cal plane turret and creating a simulation using this gun as a controller.
