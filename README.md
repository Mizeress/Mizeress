# Hello, my name is Samuel Mallia!

I am a student at Wright State University studying for a BACS in Computer Science. I enjoy camping, hiking, making music, playing games, and reading. Lately I have been volunteering at the [Champaign Aviation Museum](https://www.champaignaviationmuseum.org/)  to help out with some of their programming needs!

# Pending Projects:
  - Background randomizer: A Java App that will automatically change your desktop background at given intervals. The app will be controlled by a config file through which you can input the time interval and whether to use a local directory or an API endpoint to get the image. Eventually, this will be controlled through a UI. The ultimate goal will be for this to work cross-platform. 

  - Gun Turret Simulation: Currently, I am volunteering at the [Champaign Aviation Museum](https://www.champaignaviationmuseum.org/). At this museum I have been tasked with motion tracking a .50 cal plane turret and creating a simulation using this gun as a controller. To do this, I have used C++ to expose OpenCV code to Unity used to track ArUco markers.
